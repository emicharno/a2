			<h2>Section 0. Knowing What We Don't Know & Contextual Grounding</h2>

			<p>When conducting data analysis, it can be easy to get into specifics and harder to stay grounded in the animating reasons underlying the research in the first place. As such, I believe it is important to begin such an analysis by explicitly stating the following: Americans are experiencing a full-blown housing crisis, with embodied impacts on real humans living real lives. Particularly when advancing an analytical framework to advance a normative, justice-oriented framework, it is critical to remind oneself of the humanity represented in digits on a screen. I ask you to keep this in mind, particularly as it relates to patterns of housing inequity, that fall and have fallen disproportionately on communities of color and no- and low-income residents. The analysis I will present below should be understood as such.  Furthermore, a few terms to define before digging into data structures and ultimately discoveries and insights. These are not exhaustive but rather working definitions:</p>
				<ul>	
				<li>Corporate Ownership: The practice of corporations, real estate investment trusts, or institutional investors owning residential properties. As profit-oriented actors, corporate ownership is usually flagged in correlation to housing affordability (and ultimately displacement) concerns. </li>
				<li>Occupant Ownership: The practice of residents who live in a home owning that home. Communities with lower owner occupancy rates may bear the scars of historic housing discrimination, including exclusion from intergenerational asset-building by means of property appreciation.  </li>
				<li>Housing Discrimination: The unfair treatment of groups and/or individuals in transactions related to housing on the basis of race, ethnicity, disability, socioeconomic status, sex, gender, etc. Housing discrimination has many faces, including exclusionary zoning, historic redlining, and racially restrictive covenants. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Section 1. Let's Get to Know our Data!</h2>

			<p>For this analysis, I worked with data in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GzvL8igwfqsNKtETO21XvS18GSLj9pud" target="_blank">A2 folder</a>. Immediately from its naming convention, it is my impression that this data will provide the variables to conduct a spatiotemporal analysis of corporate vs. occupant ownership in Boston neighborhoods. The folder contains three csv files and three corresponding text files with metadata. I used each of the csv files for at least grounding and contextualization within the universe of data. More information, and some initial insights into the data, are found below.</p>

			<p>Initial Reflection: Before beginning analysis, my reflection is that this will be a relatively straightforward .csv dataset, providing two attributes to work with. One interesting flag I have, particularly given that we are working with a geospatial boundary, is that the source of the neighborhood data source is unknown. In geospatial inquiry, one can choose from many analytic scales (see the “Standard Hierarchy of Census Geographic Entities” found <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2014/07/understanding-geographic-relationships-counties-places-tracts-and-more.html" target="_blank">here</a>). You’ll notice that in this plethora of options, “neighborhood” is not one of them. Although our use of “neighborhood” typically implies geographic significance, the term is one that has geospatial but also emotional, cultural, social, and historic significance (see the fascinating New York Times visualization of New Yorkers’ varying perceptions of neighborhoods found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/29/upshot/new-york-neighborhood-guide.html" target="_blank">here</a>). For this reason, I had hoped to look at the source’s definition of neighborhood and therefore will keep this as a flag and potential source of discrepancy throughout the analysis. Additionally, I will provide a check on data structure to ensure completion of the set.

			<p>Initial Reflection: Before beginning analysis, my initial and honest reaction is to be struck by the rich amount of data included in the sample set (and by extension the sheer amount of data cleaning, processing, and collection undertaken by local municipalities and of course the U.S. Census Bureau). I have taken note of the fuzzy search terms used to identify corporations within the sample set and understand that with this methodology, I cannot make any claims to absolute truth presented by the results of the corporate vs. resident occupancy analyses. This, however, strikes me as well within a reasonable margin of error for data analysis. I also notice that methodologically, the attributes extracted from U.S. census data fields are provided for the year 2020. This provides a static glimpse into the racial and age composition of the neighborhoods, which I believe will be helpful in providing a high-level snapshot for this year and making more informed hypotheses and questions for future inquiry and even future datasets. One potential for misrepresentation that I anticipate is making sure to explicitly articulate that these demographics were not static over time (as the data is presented with years ranging from 2004 – 2024) but rather were presented for a single year (2020). </p>

			<p>Note: The above data structure visualization uses a series of distinct y axes on purpose. The point is to show the relative populations within demographic groups and not across them. Future visualizaitons in this analysis will work with a standardized y-axis.</p>

					Using the source data from the U.S. Census Bureau as provided in the metadata, I opted to complement Tableau visualizations with a spatial analysis in QGIS. Working with the source data, I noticed a discrepancy between (1) that hosted by the U.S. Census Bureau and designated as census block groups comprising Boston neighborhoods and (2) the A2 data set using census block groups. As such, I defaulted to only including those neighborhoods provided in the A2 data, which ultimately meant manually removing the Harbor Islands, Mission Hill, and Back Bay from analysis. As shown above, only the neighborhoods in the A2 data set will be included in spatial analysis and visualization. Looking at the data across different platforms (in this case, Tableau vs. QGIS) helped me to identify discrepancies across the datasets as well as spatially situate myself to the geographies at hand. The QuickMapServices functionality of QGIS made this particularly visually instructive as I was able to add a Google Satellite basemap.

			<p>Initial Reflection: Before beginning analysis, my initial thought is to acknowledge similarity between this dataset and the preceding one. Looking at the fields and attributes, this dataset removes the census data captured by the preceding .csv file to make the rate of owner-occupied properties and the rate of corporate-owned properties wieldier and more workable. Specifically, looking at trends in neighborhoods and over the 20-year timespan will be much easier given the fewer variables in this prepared dataset, although I acknowledge that it would not be wholly difficult to remove the census-derived variables from the dataset. Additionally, to my earlier question of neighborhood, I used the source data to find the following information on Analyze Boston (found <a href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhood-boundaries-approximated-by-2020-census-block-groups1" target="_blank">here</a>): “The Census Bureau does not recognize or release data for Boston neighborhoods. However, Census block groups can be aggregated to approximate Boston neighborhood boundaries to allow for reporting and visualization of Census data at the neighborhood level.” This helps to clarify my approach to and treatment of spatial data in this analysis. </p>

			<h2>Section 4. Summary Lessons Learned & Future Research Inquiries</h2>

		<p>It was highly instructive to work with these data sets for A2, as I believe they have prepared me with a strong spatial and contextual grounding to continue advancing relevant analyses of housing discrimination in Boston. I learned several helpful lessons from this analysis. On the basis of U.S. census racial groups, Boston displays the dynamics of spatial segregation. Contextualizing within the city’s history of redlining, exclusionary zoning, urban renewal eminent domain actions, and restrictive covenants, this does not come as a surprise. White Bostonians are the most populous resident group, although when disaggregated by age for children 0-17, we see that Hispanic/Latino and Black children outnumber white children in Boston neighborhoods. Understandably, the total population and children population visualizations maintain similar patterns of racial segregation. Such an insight may imply that although the population of young Hispanic/Latino and Black Bostonians is on the rise as compared to young white Bostonians, spatial segregation patterns may remain entrenched at the neighborhood level. This is all a helpful basis for understanding the dynamics of corporate ownership and average occupancy rates across all Boston neighborhoods, which between 2004-2024 rose for the former (from 5.48% to 25.29%) and fell for the latter (from 43.57% to 38.05%). The neighborhood of South Boston Waterfront displays particularly volatile year-to-year variations in average corporate ownership and average occupancy rates. Finally, the concluding analysis provides insights suggesting a correlation between corporate ownership rates and vacancy rates in Boston neighborhoods, with little to no variation introduced by size of housing stock in the neighborhood or racial demographics. This implies that across Boston’s neighborhoods (with large white and non-white demographics) high vacancy rates are correlated with high corporate ownership rates. Looking to the future, I am highly interested in building on the contents of this analysis to further uncover dynamics of corporate and occupant ownership across Boston’s neighborhoods. This analysis primarily sought to answer the first two questions (and multiple sub-questions) enumerated at the beginning of this report. Next, I would like to uncover more about the dynamics of corporate ownership as well as how corporate ownership impacts community wealth generation (particularly in non-white neighborhoods that have been historically excluded from housing asset growth).</p>
